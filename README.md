Some programs completed as part of a computer architecture class. These programs are written in assembly code for the MIPS ISA.
`bythree.s` counts up by three to the input number.
`recurse.s` calculates the result of a recursive function defined by `f(n) = 3*f(n-2) + f(n-1) + 1` with `f(0) = 2` and `f(1) = 3`.
`PlayerStats.s` reads in the names, minutes played, points scored, and assists made of a list of basketball players and sorts them by an offensive efficiency metric.
